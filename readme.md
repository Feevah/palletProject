# THIS PROJECT WAS INSPIRED BY A FRIEND OF MINE WHO GOT INTO THE PALLET BUSINESS

## HE IS IN CHARLOTTE WHICH IS SUPPOSEDLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRODUCTION HUBS IN THE US. EVERY BUSINESS NEEDS NEW PALLETS TO SHIP PRODUCTS AS WELL AS SOMEONE TO CLEAN UP AND COLLECT THEIR OLD PALLETS. HE HAS CREATED A BUSINESS WHERE HE COLLECTS OLD BROKEN PALLETS AND FIXES THEM UP LIKE NEW TO RESELL TO THE BUSINESSES WHO JUST PAID HIME TO PICK THEM UP. SEEMS PRETTY INGENIOUS TO ME. :moneybag: :moneybag: :moneybag: AND GOOD FOR THE :earth_americas: TOO!
